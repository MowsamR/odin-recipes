        200 gr bread flour about 1 1/2 cups, plus more for dusting. Can be

    </ul>

      <li>25 gr milk about 1 1/2 Tbsp</li>
      <li>75 gr water about 5 Tbsp</li>
      <li>7 gr oil about 1/2 Tbsp</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
    <h3>Prepare the dough (one day before):</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Put all the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl. Combine all the wet
        ingredients in another bowl and then gradually add into the dry
        ingredients and stir until roughly combined and then knead with your
        hands or a mixer until smooth. The dough will somewhat a bit tacky and
        soft, but it's okay, don't worry
      </li>
      <li>
        Spray the dough with some water and then cover and rest for at least 4
        hours or for as long as 8-10 hours (put in the fridge if you plan to do
        longer than 4 hours)
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Let the dough comes to room temperature:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        you rest the dough in the fridge, 2 hours before you plan to make, get
        the dough out from the fridge and let it set at the counter for about 2
        hours to get it back to room temperature
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Shape the dough:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Lightly flour your work surface with some flour. Dust your hands with
        some flour too. The dough will be incredibly soft at this point as it
        should be
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the dough out into about 1/2 cm in thickness and into a rectangle
        shape. Use a dough cutter to cut the dough in half, and then each half
        into 8 pieces (as shown in photos above). you will get 6 large pieces
        and the ends will give you shorter piece (but hey..they are still tasty,
        just shorter ðŸ™‚ )
      </li>
      <li>
        Stack one strip of dough on top of the other. Use a knife or dough
        cutter to make a line in the center. Be careful not to cut through the
        dough. Repeat with the rest
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Techniques you need to know to fry the dough:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat about 2-3 inches of cooking oil over medium heat. Make sure
        there is enough of oil or you tiao won't puff up nicely. Dip a chopstick
        or a skewer into an oil, if it bubbles vigorously around it, the oil is
        a bit too hot. Lower the heat to between medium and low, closer to low
        and try again. There may be still a bit of bubbles, but shouldn't be too
        much bubbles
      </li>
      <li>
        Pick up one strip of dough using your thumbs and index fingers at both
        ends and gently stretch the dough to the length that will fit into your
        fryer and gently put the dough into the hot oil
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a chopstick to gently roll the dough around as it is frying. Do not
        use a chopstick to squeeze the dough or it won't puff. Just gently nudge
        the dough to roll it around so it puffs up nicely
      </li>
      <li>
        Watch the heat and fry the dough until it has nice golden brown. We
        don't want the dough to get dark on the outside but still uncooked on
        the inside. The heat should be at low-medium. Try to fry one at a time
        if possible
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the youtiao to an absorbent paper towel and repeat with the rest
        of the dough
      </li>
    </ol>
